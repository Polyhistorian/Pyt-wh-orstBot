*TODO:*
-
- Donald Trump Tweet Generator

- If someone has any additional ideas feel free to throw them at me on discord FinnishArmy#9973

*New additions inspired by my friend:*
-
- Administrative features

- Some kind of feeds? Not sure what exactly he meant.

  (Probably twitter or rss, let's try to implement both)
  
- Youtube notifications etc. (So like twitch and ??? grouped with that)

*Another set of potentially new features, from another friend:*
-
- wh!colourMe command, to assign colour roles to people without ManageRoles permission
    - Add an alias wh!colorMe for it.
    
- Poll support
