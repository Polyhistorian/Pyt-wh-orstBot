# Pyt⟨wh⟩orstBot
Just incase anyone cares: Not saying anything about python itself, just found a space in the name to express my horrendous coding skills.

Packages used; aiohttp, async_timeout, discord.py and some other things

And if you for some god forsaken reason want to use this bot;

- Copy the provided "example_config.json" to a file named "config.json" (both without the quotes).
- After that just fill in the provided fields.
- Set the provided venv3.6 as the virtual environment (Or construct similar yourself)
- And then you should be able to run the provided "main.py"
