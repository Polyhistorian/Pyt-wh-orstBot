# Pyt⟨wh⟩orstBot
Just in case anyone cares: Not saying anything about python itself, just found a space in the name to express my horrendous coding skills.

And if you for some god forsaken reason want to use this bot;

- The library requires the use of python version 3.6.\*, so download that
- Install "discord.py" and "request" libraries
- Copy the provided "example_config.json" to a file named "config.json" (both without the quotes).
- After that just fill in the provided fields.
- And then you should be able to run the provided "main.py" successfully.
