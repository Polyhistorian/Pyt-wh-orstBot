# Pyt⟨wh⟩orstBot
Just in case anyone cares: Not saying anything about python itself, just found a space in the name to express the horrendous way I've written the code back then.

This is a bot built to fetch ability information from the overwatch wiki, and parse it into a nice embed.

~~And if you for some reason want to use this bot;~~

- ~~The library requires the use of python version 3.6.\*, so download that~~
- ~~Install "discord.py" and "request" libraries~~
- ~~Copy the provided "example_config.json" to a file named "config.json" (both without the quotes).~~
- ~~After that just fill in the provided fields.~~
- ~~And then you should be able to run the provided "main.py" successfully.~~

Something has quite recently broken most if not all of the functionality of the bot. I might fix it at some point, but currently I'm preoccupied with school work, and in the freetime I have left I have another on-going project.
